# Design and Evaluation of an Interactive VR Data Story for Promoting the Situation Awareness of Public Health Threats
We implemented **a case of VR data story** with five design considerations:
1. (Providing) Alternative data representations, 
2. (Considering) Multiple perspectives for situational understanding,
3. (Offering) Embodied interactions for improving the sense of presence,
4. Combining audio and visual channels,
5. (Leveraging) Spatial cues for story exploration and awareness-raising.

The story aims to communicate health risk information to the public and raise people's situation awareness of the potential health threats in public environments.

## Functions in this case of VR Data Story:
1. Three kinds of immersive data representations of Covid-19 depiction (trajectory, particles, heatmap).
2. We offer three types of perspectives for users to experience: the 1st-person perspective, the 3rd-person perspective, and the perspective of the characters (i.e., the students and the teacher).
3. We implemented four kinds of embodied interactions in the VR data story, including VR wrist menu, interactive buttons within the environment, an interactive concentration indicator board that show the level of Covid-19 based on users' locations, and two movement methods (continuous movement and VR teleportation).
4. We converted and refined the original textual content of the data story into spatial audio clips in VR to guide users to understand and explore the story.
5. We provided several useful spatial cues in the form of visual and textual elements in the immersive data story.
