# Design and Evaluation of an Interactive VR Data Story for Promoting the Situation Awareness of Public Health Threats
We implemented **a case of VR data story** with five design considerations:
1. (Providing) Alternative data representations, 
2. (Considering) Multiple perspectives for situational understanding,
3. (Offering) Embodied interactions for improving the sense of presence,
4. Combining audio and visual channels,
5. (Leveraging) Spatial cues for story exploration and awareness-raising.

The story aims to communicate health risk information to the public and raise people's situation awareness of the potential health threats in public environments.
